		content = "The City of St. Louis (which is an independent city separate from St. Louis County) has a [well documented](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/amid-drumbeat-from-falling-bricks-st-louis-to-ramp-up/article_1e237c9c-95e7-5c01-8d0c-92a2fe1a5c78.html) pattern of extensive vacancy. What is not well known, however, is the actual number of vacancies in the city. A variety of estimates have been made in the last several decades. Most recently, the Mayor's office released an estimate of at least 24,000 vacant properties as part of the City's [Preliminary Resilience Assessment](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/initiatives/resilience/documents/upload/PRA1001_Report_Inside_10.pdf). Our *Urban Prairies* project aims to produce estimates of vacancy at the parcel level in St. Louis. [As of January 2017](/vacancy17), we believe that there are between 32,431 (25%) and 48,013 (37%) vacant parcels out of a total of 128,644. We are particularly interested in how vacant land clusters spatially to produce areas in St. Louis that appear to 'return to nature'."
