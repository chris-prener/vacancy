<p>The data used to develop <a href="https://github.com/chris-prener/vacancy-data">our initial listof vacant properties</a> was culled from a number of different sources. The first three were considered <strong>primary indicators</strong> - if one or more were true, the property was considered vacant in both the low and the high estimates.</p>
