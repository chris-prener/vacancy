<p>Data used to develop <a href="https://github.com/chris-prener/vacancy-data">our initial list of vacant properties</a> was culled from a number of different sources. The first three were considered <strong>primary indicators</strong> - if one or more were true, the property was considered vacant in both the low and the high estimates.</p>
<p>The remaining five indicators were what we refer to as <strong>secondary indicators</strong>. These were drawn from a mix of data sources, all of which were longitudinal in nature. The database with the narrowest range of dates, the building permits data, began in 1992. Unless otherwise noted, all other data sources were filtered so that observations before January 1, 1992, were removed.</p>
<p>Given the varying quality of St. Louis’s data, we felt that circumspection was warranted with our analyses. The low estimate was a more conservative estimate that included any parcel that had a positive primary indicator or at least two separate positive secondary indicators. The high estimate was a less conservative estimate that had a positive primary indicator or at least one positive secondary indicator.</p>
