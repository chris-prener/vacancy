The data used to develop [our initial listof vacant properties](https://github.com/chris-prener/vacancy-data) was culled from a number of different sources. The first three were considered **primary indicators** - if one or more were true, the property was considered vacant in both the low and the high estimates.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  Indicator = c("(1) Vacant Lot", 
                "(2) Land Reutilization Authority (LRA) Property",
                "(3) Land Clearence for Redevelopment Authority (LCRA) Property"),
  Source = c("(A) Property Ownership Database", 
             "(A) Property Ownership Database and (B) LRA Sale Data",
             "(A) Property Ownership Database"),
  Description = c("Represents the City's assessment of the property as a vacant lot.",
                  "Combines data on property ownership with the LRA's own sales list to identify properties held in the City's land bank.",
                  "Identifies properties held by the City's development agency."),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

knitr::kable(
  data, caption = "Data Sources"
)
```
